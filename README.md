# Task-Manager
Smart Task Manager is a modern, fast, and minimal task-management app built entirely with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. It focuses on solving real productivity problems: prioritization, overwhelm, cognitive load, and poor task planning.

The app doesn’t just store tasks — it thinks with the user.
Using effort tags, priority levels, due dates, and a smart scoring heuristic, it recommends the next best task, calculates Estimated Completion Time (ECT), and helps users focus using a dedicated Focus Mode.

With adaptive warnings, clean UI components, responsive layout, and smooth card behavior (clamp, expand, reorder), this project demonstrates practical front-end engineering grounded in user experience and clear, maintainable logic.
